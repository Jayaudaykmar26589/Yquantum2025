Quantum Hash Function Analysis
Introduction
This document analyzes the quantum hash function designed for the Superquantum Challenge. The function utilizes quantum circuit simulations to create a cryptographically secure hash function that produces deterministic outputs while being resistant to various cryptographic attacks.
Design Principles
The design is based on several key principles:

Limited qubit count: We cap the number of qubits at 20 to maintain computational feasibility while still providing cryptographic security.
Multi-layered approach: We implement multiple circuit layers with different operations to ensure complexity.
Entanglement: We use controlled operations to create entanglement between qubits, which is essential for quantum advantage.
Multiple basis measurements: We measure expectation values in different bases (X, Y, Z) to capture the full quantum state information.
Final classical mixing: We apply post-processing to ensure the avalanche effect and to stretch the quantum measurements to fill the desired output size.

Analysis Against Criteria
1. Output Determinism
The hash function is deterministic - it will always produce the same output for a given input. This is guaranteed because:

The quantum circuit construction is deterministic based on input bytes
We use expectation values rather than sampling from measurements
The post-processing steps are deterministic

2. Preservation of Entropy
The function preserves entropy well because:

Initial Hadamard gates create a uniform superposition
Multiple measurement bases capture full quantum state information
The final mixing step helps distribute entropy across the output
XOR operations and bit rotations in the final stage ensure uniform distribution

To quantitatively demonstrate entropy preservation, we can examine the distribution of output bytes when fed with random inputs:
